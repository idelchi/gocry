`gocry` is a command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting files using a specified key.

It supports both file encryption and line-by-line encryption based on directives within the file.

The tool can read the file from stdin and write the encrypted/decrypted content to stdout,
making it suitable for use as a filter in git.

## Installation

### Commands

#### `encrypt` - Encrypt content

Encrypt a file or specific lines within a file.

Examples:

```sh
# Encrypt an entire file
gocry -f path/to/keyfile encrypt input.txt > encrypted.txt.enc

# Encrypt specific lines in a file
gocry -f path/to/keyfile -m line encrypt input.txt > encrypted.txt
```

#### `decrypt` - Decrypt content

Decrypt a file or specific lines within a file.

Examples:

```sh
# Decrypt an entire file
gocry -f path/to/keyfile decrypt encrypted.txt.enc > decrypted.txt.dec

# Decrypt specific lines in a file
gocry -f path/to/keyfile -m line decrypt encrypted.txt > decrypted.txt
```

### Git Integration

gocry can be used as a filter in git for automatic encryption/decryption of files.

When stdin is given, gocry reads the file from stdin (using the file arguments for logging),
and writes the encrypted/decrypted content to stdout.

**.gitconfig:**

```gitconfig
[filter "encrypt:line"]
    clean = "gocry -f ~/.secrets/key -m line encrypt %f"
    smudge = "gocry -f ~/.secrets/key  -m line decrypt %f"
    required = true

[filter "encrypt:file"]
    clean = "gocry -f ~/.secrets/key -m file encrypt  %f"
    smudge = "gocry -f ~/.secrets/key -m file decrypt %f"
    required = true
```

**.gitattributes:**

```gitattributes
*                       filter=encrypt:line
**/secrets/*            filter=encrypt:file
```

### Line-by-Line Encryption

When using `--mode line`, gocry processes only lines containing specific directives:

**Input Example:**

```text
This is a normal line.
This line will be encrypted. ### DIRECTIVE: ENCRYPT
Another normal line.
```

**After Encryption:**

```text
This is a normal line.
### DIRECTIVE: DECRYPT: VGhpcyBsaW5lIHdpbGwgYmUgZW5jcnlwdGVkLiBPRmx2eGZpRk9GMkF3PT0=
Another normal line.
```

**After Decryption:**

```text
This is a normal line.
This line will be encrypted. ### DIRECTIVE: ENCRYPT
Another normal line.
```

For detailed help on any command:

```sh
gocry --help
gocry <command> --help
```

## TODO

Allow for ENCRYPT/DECRYPT on the next line
